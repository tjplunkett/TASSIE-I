The TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets (TASSIE) follow-up program is conducted at the University of Tasmania Greenhill Observatory.
In this repository, we show the jupyter notebooks used for analysis in our first paper. 
Note: some code had to be cut from the .ipynb file as the size was too large to upload. However, this was all work that was not included within the paper 
and was mainly auxillary plots related to kinematics, mutli-term lomb-scargle fitting and 2MASS images. 

We will update this repo with the H50 data once the paper is published. We do not upload the Kesseli et al. 2019 and Pecaut & Mamajek 2013 data here,
out of respect for the original work. These can be found online on Vizier or through personal websites. 

Thanks for reading and clear skies!
